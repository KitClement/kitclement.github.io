  <h1>CODAP Sampler Companion Tools</h1>
  <p>
    This website is a companion to the CODAP Sampler plugin. CODAP's sampler is a great tool for simulating random chance outcomes, but often it is very difficult to create mixers without excessive tedious data entry. This website gives a couple of tools to help you build samplers quickly:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Mixer Builder</b>: This tool helps with building a sampler out of categorical outcomes, which often requires many copies of the same entry, especially when sampling without replacement. You can specify how many categories there are in your random process, then how many times each outcome should appear.</li>
      <li><b>CSV Import</b>: This tool helps with taking a specific column of a CSV data file to import into a sampler. There is a collector tool that allows for importing data from a file in CODAP, but the collector tool is not possible to use once using multiple devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
  <p>Thank you to the Concord Consortium for their continued development of CODAP and making this application free to use. The companion tools on this website were built with the assistance of AI. Any CSV file used on this website is handled locally and is not stored on any server, so there should be no concerns of data privacy by using this tool.</p>
