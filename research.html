<div class="pgs"><h2>Research</h2>
<p>I graduated from Portland State University with my PhD in Mathematics Education. I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rhjg07TDFU">defended</a> my <a href="https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/open_access_etds/6428/">dissertation</a> in 2023, and my committee was co-chaired by <a href="https://evathanheiser.wordpress.com/research-2/">Eva Thanheiser</a> and <a href="https://www.terc.edu/profiles/jennifer-noll/">Jennifer Noll</a>. I am currently collaborating on one active <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1823081">NSF grant</a> led by Jennifer Noll on modeling and simulation using TinkerPlots, and I am currently planning on a future proposal to develop modern modeling and simulation software that integrates with R and assess student reasoning using this technology.</p>

<h2>Undergraduate Research</h2>

<p>I'm interested in working with undergraduate students at the University of Illinois on education-focused research projects. Despite being in a statistics department, the majority of my work is <b>qualitative</b> in nature rather than quantitative. If you have a project idea in this research area and are interested in working with me, especially if you are a statistics major and qualify for <a href="https://stat.illinois.edu/academics/graduate-programs/undergraduate-research">URES</a>, please reach out! </p>

<p>I will likely only take on 1-2 projects at most at any given time, so I may not be available to work with you. Most of my research is centered around my Stat 200 course, so most students who work with me on research should be familiar with this course as a CA or student. Additionally, if you send me an email about research interests that are not my focus (e.g. machine learning, LLM models, statistical analysis, etc.), you likely won't get a response at all from me, as I will assume you are email-blasting our entire department without checking anyone's specific research interests.</p>

<p>The nature of qualitative research makes it difficult to complete a meaningful project within the span of 1 semester. Thus, if you are interested in working on a research project, this is roughly the process I would follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Semseter 1: read existing statistics education research literature and discuss that work with me. Through reading the literature, we can hopefully find a project that is interesting to you and is a meaningful contribution to statistics education. 
<li>End of Sem 1 or beginning of Sem 2: Design study (e.g. build interview protocol, set up Qualtrics survey) and conduct data collection.
<li>Semester 2: Analyze the data and work on presentations for URES and undergraduate research symposium.
</ul>
