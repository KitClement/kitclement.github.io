They provide insight into your intellectual curiosity, work ethic, and potential that extend well beyond the grades on your transcript. In my experience, a strong recommendation is built on a foundation of genuine engagement and personal connection. While a good grade in one of my courses is a piece of this puzzle, I cannot write a strong letter on the basis of your grade alone, and this is already covered in your application through transcripts regardless.</p>

<h3>Building a Relationship</h3>
	<p>While I do my best to make my courses active and more personal, the reality is that even if you take my course and you participate in your groups or in full class discussions, I won't have the basis to write a personal recommendation letter for you, and may not even know your name if I see you out on campus. Students who receive strong letters from me have likely done one (or more!) of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Frequently visited drop-in hours</b> - Coming to drop-in hours will allow you to build a relationship with me that puts us on a first-name basis. You don't have to come to drop-in hours to discuss coursework, it could be to discuss future classes, research interests (especially if you're interested in education research!), or plans after college. It's an easy way to put a name to a face for me and discussions like these allow me to get a better sense of your personal qualities. If you can't make my personal drop-in hour, I am always open for appointments, and I'm likely to be around when other CAs are hosting drop-in hours too!
		<li><b>Frequently discussed course topics with me after class</b> - Many students who got strong letters of rec from me might not be able to visit my drop-in hours, but made a habit out of discussing class activities or assignments with me after class. 
		<li><b>Worked with me as a CA</b> - Not everyone can be a CA for my course, but if you are, we've likely built a strong personal relationship where I get to see your work ethic, creativity, and professionalism. 
		<li><b>Worked on a research project with me</b> - Similar to being a CA, working on a research project with me will give me a basis to evaulate your personal traits that I can write about in a letter.
	</ul>
	<p>If I were to accept a request from a student that did not pursue one of the above avenues, the letter would have to look something like <a href="badrecsample.pdf">this</a>. This is not a good letter of recommendation, and I don't plan to submit that on anyone's behalf. It doesn't mean you are a bad student, it just means I don't have the proper background to write anything more about you.
	
<h3>Requesting a Letter</h3>
	<p>If you believe you are a strong candidate for a letter of recommendation based on the criteria above, please consider the following steps to request a letter:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Reach out to me via email at least <b>4 weeks</b> before your first deadline, and write the email yourself (it's obvious when you use ChatGPT). I will not write a letter on shorter notice. You must indicate in your email that you have read this page on my website. 
	<li>If I've agreed to write you a letter, please create a Google Drive folder entitled "Your Name Recommendations" (e.g. "Cade Smith Recommendations") which has the following:
		<ul>
		<li>A Google Sheet with a row for each program you are applying to. It should have the following columns:
			<ul>
			<li>Program name
			<li>A link to the program info page
			<li>Submission deadline
			<li>Submission process (e.g. direct email, link given, link automatically sent via email, someone from program will contact me, etc.)
			<li>Submission link (if needed)
			<li>A checkbox column so I can check off when I've submitted the letter
			</ul>
		<li>Your current CV/resume.
		<li>Your current transcript.
		<li>A Google Doc that includes your name as it will appear on the application, pronouns, and anything I should know about what you have done with me that I should include in the letter. Important: I will not speak to what I have not personally observed, but this is your chance to make sure I highlight relevant experiences on your letter!
		<li>Any additional materials (essays, personal statements) that you are using to apply to the programs.
		</ul>
	<li>Share this Google Drive folder with me, and then send me an email when you have completed uploading all of the materials above in the folder. 
	<li>You must have this Google Drive folder completed within 3 weeks of the first deadline. 
	</ul>
